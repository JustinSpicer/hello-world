Just another repository


My name is Justin Spicer. Being a computer science major at Northern Kentucky University, I find it very important to learn the in's and out's of GitHub. I feel learning and mastering this will allow for an improvement in team projects as well as understanding the importance and efficiency that GitHub provides in group assignments.
